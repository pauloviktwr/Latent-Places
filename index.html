  " YOU MADE IT TO THE LATENT RELAY. "
  <br>
  " AFTER THE FALL OF THE OLD INTERNET, WE’VE BEEN OPERATING OUR OWN HIDDEN NODE, TRANSMITTING FROM SECRET LOCATIONS AND DISCONNECTED TERRITORIES. "
  <br>
  " THE PHENOMENA WE INVESTIGATE OCCUR IN RESTRICTED AREAS LINKED TO ANCIENT LABORATORIES, WHERE UNEXPLAINED EVENTS HAVE LONG BEEN RECORDED AND STUDIED. "
  <br>
  " WE’VE BEEN HOSTING TRADES OF OUTDATED COMMUNICATION DEVICES, WHICH REMAIN THE ONLY SAFE WAY TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENT THESE PHENOMENA. "
  <br>
  " LATENT RELAY IS THE HUB TO LINK UP, SHARE DATA, TRADE OLD DEVICES, AND DISCUSS THE STRANGE PHENOMENA AFFECTING OUR COASTS AND SKYLINES. "
